#pseudocode insertion sort
# - Start at first index
#  - evaluate that expression
# - move to the next index
#  - evaluate that expression and determine if higher or lower than previous index
#  - if lower, move to the left, if higher, keep where it is
# - move to the next index
#  - evaluate that index
#  - if lower, move into the sorted indices, if higher, keep where it is
#- continue to iterate through list until you reach an entire sorted array
