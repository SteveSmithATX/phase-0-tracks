<li>What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?</li>
<p>Semantic tags give meaning to a web page. I personally like div and a href tags</p>
<li>What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?</li>
<p>The broser displays based off of the code being read from top to bottom.</p>
<li>What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?</li>
<p>I leared that Sublime is more functioal than I thought. Code snippets can probably help a lot. For sure I'll be making more.</p>
<li>What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?</li>
<p>The hardest part of this challenge was figuring where in the html to put the semantic elements in order for them to work properly.  I'll definitely have to do more research.</p>
